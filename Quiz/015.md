# Quiz 15

There are N closed doors in a school and N students present. The first student opens each door. The second student flips (openâ‡†close) every second door. The third student flips every third door, and so on. 

[SL]Create a function that shows the doors after 5 students.

## code

```py
def open_doors(N:int):
    doors = []
    for student in range(N):
        doors.append(False)
    for door in range(1,(N+1)):
        for n in range(1,N):
            if n % door == 0:
                doors[n-1] = not doors[n-1]
                turns = doors.count(True)
    return(turns)

num1 = open_doors(10)
print(num1)

num2 = open_doors(101)
print(num2)

num3 = open_doors(200)
print(num3)

num4 = open_doors(5678)
print(num4)                                                                           
```
