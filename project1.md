# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

I will to design and make an electronic ledger for a client who is interested in crypto curency trading, specificaly the Dogecoin. The program will organize Ms. Sato's transaction and is constructed using the software pycharm. This crypto wallet will provide efficient and simple-to-understand functions that would help the client achieve a better understanding of the Doge coin and help organize her digtal transactions. 

## Rationale for proposed solution

I have chosen Dogecoin as my crypto currency because despite being a cryptocurrency that originated as online jokes, Dogecoin has grown a loyal user base. It still has a market valuation in the hundreds of millions of dollars till this day. Furthermore, high liquidity makes it simpler for investors to invest in and withdraw from Dogecoin. As its price rises, more celebrities, like Elon Musk, are likely to endorse it, creating an upward price pressure[2].
  
This electronic ledger would be constructed by Python 3 in Pycharm. I decided to use Pycharm because it helps write clean and maintainable code as the IDE helps maintain quality control with PEP8 checks, test assistance, smart refactorings, and numerous inspections [3]. Furthermore, the reason for using Python 3 is that is has clear, existing commands already built into the code, has simple syntax, making it very user-friendly - especially for me to be able to focus my time on designing rather than the coding process. Additionally, Python3 is commonly utilized for data analytics. Data may be gathered and managed securely using Python 3. Last but not least, Python3 is a wonderful fit for finance in dealing with quantitative data because the main objective is to establish a digital wallet for the customer[4].
  
CSV files were used to store data of this wallet: including tthe username and password, as well as the transactions being made. The reason behind using a CSV file is CSV files are plain-text files, making them easier for the website developer to create. Since they're plain text, they're easier to import into a spreadsheet or another storage database, such as in python[5].
  
It will take 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A, B and C.

## Information about the Doge coin

Dogecoin (DOGE) is a peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency. It was introduced in December 2013 as an alternative cryptocurrency, and its logo is a Shiba Inu dog. The blockchain of Dogecoin has appeal since it uses Litecoin's core technology. Dogecoin, which employs the scrypt algorithm, is notable for its low cost and limitless supply. Dogecoin marketed itself as a "fun" version of Bitcoin with a Shibu Inu dog as its logo. Dogecoin's casual presentation suited the mood of the burgeoning crypto community. Its scrypt technology and unlimited supply were an argument for a faster, more adaptable, and more consumer-friendly version of Bitcoin. Many different types of businesses accept DOGE including Elon Musk's SpaceX and the Dallas Mavericks. Many Dogecoin holders use their DOGE to tip content creators on Reddit and other social media platforms [2]. 


## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger is protected by password and username.
5. The electronic ledger lets the user convert USD to Doge coin.
6. The electronic ledger will show the latest transactions with dates of the current year.
