# Criteria A: Planning




## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make an electronic ledger for a client who is interested in crypto curency trading, specificaly the doge coin. The program will will organize Ms. Sato's transaction and is constructed using the software pycharm. It will take  3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A & B.

Created in late 2013, DOGE was created as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, but it's become seriously valuable. The name and Shiba Inu logo are based on a meme. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed to be scarce, Dogecoin is intentionally abundant â€” with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply.
