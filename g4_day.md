*Q: How many USB memories of 4Gb would be required to download the memories of an adult?*

**Calculations:**

according to a 2010 article in Scientific American, "the memory capacity of the human brain was 
reported to have the equivalent of *2.5 petabytes of memory capacity*"

1 perabyte = 1,000 terabytes

2.5 perabytes = 2,500 terabytes

1 terabyte = 1 gigabyte

2500 terabytes = 2,500,000 gigabytes

This means that an adult can store memories worth of **2,500,000 gigabytes**

which means the amount of 4Gb USB memories needed to download it 

= 2,500,000/4

= ***625000 USB memories***
